    title: 'How old is Swahili and where did it originate from?',
    content: 'Swahili had its origin at the East African coast where it was used as a lingua franca and trade language, starting from the 7th and 8th centuries A.D. At that time the local people were involved in brisk trade â€” especially with Arabs etc. But they did not have a common language among them and there were no major or dominant ethnic groups whose language could be adopted. Thus everybody spoke their own language in order to interact with others and as a result, a linguistic mixture came into being. So nobody can claim that Swahili is their mother tongue, even though these days there are many East Africans who speak only Swahili as their mother tongue due to intermarriages among the different ethnic groups. The small Kenyan coastal town of Lamu is generally regarded as the cradle of Kiswahili.'
